## Questions
1. Detect rating by words in description
2. Can I detect the type of wine by words in description
3. Look for underrated wine varietal in terms of price ex. high rating low price

```{r Question 1 - Detect Rating by Words in Description}
library(tidytext)


# Want to check to see which words are most frequently used among each of the six ratings
bigram_text <-  data %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>% 
  # remove "stop words" like 'and', 'or' and 'what'
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
  # add "custom" stop words to remove
  filter(!word %in% c("wine", "drink")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z]"))

bigram_text <- bigram_text %>% 
  separate(word, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ") 

bigram_text <- bigram_text %>% 
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  filter(!word3 %in% stop_words$word)

bigram_counts <- bigram_text %>% 
  count(rating, word1, word2, word3, sort = TRUE)

glimpdata_text <- data %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %>% 
  # remove "stop words" like 'and', 'or' and 'what'
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
  # add "custom" stop words to remove
  filter(!word %in% c("wine", "drink")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "[a-z]"))

```
